Bluetooth low energy SDK for Renesas RL78
=========================================

This file describes some features of the porting of BLE SDK to the RL78 architecture.

:numbered:
Characteristics of RL78
-----------------------

The RL78 is a Harvard architecture CPU because it has one bus for fetching instructions 
and another one for fetching data, however it has just one memory space for both, 
code memory and data memory. Code is saved in flash memory which is located in the lower 
part of is memory map while the data memory is located in RAM memory which is in the 
higher part of its memory map.

RL78 is a 16bit microcontroller and implements little endian for data allocation. For 
more specific details about the RL78 internal contruction please refer to RL78 User 
Software Manual <<1>>

NOTE: The endianess refers to the way data is stored in memory<<2>>. 'Big endian' correspond 
to MSB in the lowest address, while 'low endian' corresponds to MSB in the highest address.

The board used for porting SDK-BLE-Arduino was the Renesas demo board YRPBRL78G13. It contains
a RL78/G13 chip, specifically the R5F100LEAFB. It has 64Kb of Flash memory and 4Kb of RAM memory.
For further details please refer to the Renesas documentation website of this board. <<3>>

Hardware implementation
-----------------------

The hardware connection is explained in the *README* file of the git repo. Here are two 
examples of possible hardware implementations. The first one uses an Arduino for providing the 
necessary 3.3V for the nRF8001/nRF24L01+, and the second one uses an external voltage regulator
that outputs 3.3V.

Implementation using an Arduino
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The next image depicts the connection of all elements.

.All elements with Arduino
image::images/All_with_arduino.png[System with arduino image, link="https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/ble-sdk-RL78/blob/master/documentation/Images/All_with_arduino.png"]

As it can be seen on the previous image the Arduino is only connected via its power plug and no USB
cable is used. Also can be seen that the 5V and 3.3V output pins of the Arduino are connected to the
nRF8001/nRF24L01+. The ACI/SPI pins of the nRF8001/nRF24L01+ are connected to the YRPBRL78G13 board,
to which it is also connected a serial adapter for seeing its output.

Next image shows a closer view of the Arduino connections.

As well next image shows a closer view of the nRF8001/nRF24L01+ connections.

.Radio connections
image::images/Radio.png[Radio image]

On the left side can be seen the ACI/SPI connection and as the image shows not all the ACI/SPI pins 
are used. On the right side is power pins connection coming from the Arduino.



Next image depicts the connections of the YRPBRL78G13 board.

In the previous image can be seen which pins are for the serial adapter and which ones are power
pins. All the other pins are used for ACI/SPI connection. For further details about how connections
should be please refer to the *README* file of this repo.


[[X1]]
Implementation using an external regulator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Other possibility for connecting the hardware is to use an external voltage regulator. The next image 
depicts the connection of all elements.

.All elements with external regulator
image::images/All_with_reg.png[System with external regulator image]

Connections are almost the same for most of the elements. The YRPBRL78G13 board and the 
nRF8001/nRF24L01+ have exactly the same connections. For this reason its images are not shown again.
A closer look of the external regulator connections can be seen in the next image.

.Regulator connection
image::images/Regulator.png[Regulator image]

On the left side comes the 5V input from the YRPBRL78G13 board, and on the right side is the 3.3V output
that goes to the nRF8001/nRF24L01+.

Memory usage of example projects
--------------------------------

The present implementation of the BLE-SDK-RL78 contains three example projects.

* *ble_aci_transport_layer_verification:* This example project tests that the ACI/SPI hardware 
works properly.
* *ble_my_project_template:* This example project is an empty template that can be used for 
starting a new projects.
* *ble_A_Hello_World_Program:* This example project sends via Bluetooth/UART the string +"Hello world"+

For further explanation about the examples please refer to the examples documentation on the 
original SDK-BLE-Arduino repo. <<3>>

This repo contains all the IAR project files so you can either download the source files 
and create a workspace where you can add the three examples as stated on the *README* file, or 
just download all the repo files and open the IAR workspace that it contains.
